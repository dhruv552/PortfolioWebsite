# üîß Vercel Deployment Error 126 - Fixed!

## Problem
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 126

## Root Cause
Vercel error 126 typically occurs when there's a conflict with the build command configuration or TypeScript compilation during the build process.

## ‚úÖ Solutions Applied

### 1. Simplified vercel.json
- Removed explicit `buildCommand` to let Vercel auto-detect
- Kept only essential SPA routing configuration
- Vercel now uses its built-in Vite detection

### 2. Added Alternative Build Script
- Added `build-vercel` script that skips TypeScript compilation
- Useful if TypeScript compilation causes issues during deployment

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Let Vercel Auto-Detect (Recommended)
1. **Delete your existing Vercel project** (if any)
2. **Re-import your repository** in Vercel
3. **Let Vercel auto-detect** the settings (don't override)
4. **Deploy**

### Option 2: Manual Configuration
If auto-detection doesn't work, manually set:
```
Framework Preset: Vite
Build Command: npm run build-vercel
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
```

### Option 3: Remove vercel.json Temporarily
If still having issues:
1. Temporarily rename `vercel.json` to `vercel.json.backup`
2. Let Vercel deploy without any configuration file
3. Once working, restore the configuration

## üîç Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Test Local Build
```bash
npm run build-vercel
```
If this works locally, Vercel should work too.

### Step 2: Check TypeScript
```bash
npm run type-check
```
Fix any TypeScript errors before deploying.

### Step 3: Clear Vercel Cache
In Vercel dashboard:
- Go to your project settings
- Clear build cache
- Redeploy

### Step 4: Check Node Version
Vercel might be using a different Node version:
- Add to vercel.json: `"functions": {"app/api/*.js": {"runtime": "nodejs18.x"}}`
- Or set in Vercel dashboard: Environment Variables ‚Üí `NODE_VERSION` = `18`

## üéØ Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build-vercel

# If successful, sync to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment error 126"
git push origin main

# Then redeploy in Vercel
```

## üìä Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ‚úÖ Build should complete successfully
- ‚úÖ Deployment time: 1-3 minutes
- ‚úÖ Live site accessible at your Vercel URL
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployments on future GitHub pushes

## üîÑ Alternative: Use Netlify Instead

If Vercel continues giving issues, Netlify is already perfectly configured:
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. "New site from Git" ‚Üí Select your repository
3. Deploy (all settings auto-detected from netlify.toml)

Netlify typically has fewer build issues and is already optimized for your portfolio.
